      <strong>Saint Ignatius of Antioch </strong> was the third bishop of Antioch, following the apostle Peter and Eudius making him on of the earliest leaders of the Christian church there. He aquired the office of bishop in about 68AD a position he held until his martyrdom in 107AD.</p><br>
        <p class="quotes">“It is better to keep silence and be something than to talk and be nothing.” <br>― Ignatius of Antioch, Letter to the Ephesians </p>
<br>
<p>At that time Antioch was still ruled by the Roman Empire and as a result he and his church often suffered persecution for their faith. Hoping to make an example of Ignatius and discourage the spread of Christianity, the Roman authorities  arrested him and took him to Rome to be executed. Instead Ignatius encouraged the Christians en route to Rome and wrote 7 letters encouraging them to stand firm in the face of death. <br> In 107ad, Ignatius was fed to lions in the Roman Arena. </p><br>
    
        <p class="quotes">“I would rather die for Christ than rule the whole earth.”<br>― Ignatius of Antioch</p>
